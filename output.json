The sound emitted from their instruments could have been severely affected by the elements.</p>\n<p>They were very insistent on playing live until it became clear that it would be too cold,&#8221; Carole Florman, a spokeswoman for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, told the New York Times.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It would have been a disaster if we had done it any other way.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t Milli Vanilli,” she said, referring to the 1980s group stripped of their Grammy for lip-synching.</p>\n<p>In 1991, Whitney Houston’s jaw-dropping performance of the National Anthem at that year’s Superbowl – arguably the best performance of the Anthem to date – also turned out to be lip-synched.</p>\n<p>“The music was pre-recorded, and so was the vocal,” musical director Rickey Minor confirmed to ABC News. Minor, who is currently the musical head of “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,” explained that with such a large crowd it would have been impossible for Houston to hear herself.</p>\n<p>The Times of London  also claims the Marine Corps Band was not playing, despite the fact that band director Michael J. Colburn was seen emphatically making conducting gestures on television.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All music [for inaugural ceremonies] is prerecorded as a matter of course,&#8221; a spokesperson for the Marine Corps Band told Washingtonian Magazine, &#8220;and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve done for years and years. The Marine Band did perform live throughout the ceremony but we received last-minute word that Beyoncé wanted to use the recording.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well what do you think about that?

She had claimed in court that she was forced to take the drugs into the country by a gang that was threatening to hurt her children.</p>\n<p>Indonesia, like many Asian countries, is very strict on drug crimes, and most of the more than 40 foreigners on its death row were convicted of drug charges.</p>\n<p>Sandiford&#8217;s lawyer said she would appeal, a process that can take several years. Condemned criminals face a firing squad in Indonesia, which has not carried out an execution since 2008, when 10 people were put to death.</p>\n<p>A verdict is expected in the trial of Sandiford&#8217;s alleged accomplice, Briton Julian Anthony Pounder, next Tuesday. He is accused of receiving the drugs in Bali, which has a busy bar and nightclub scene where party drugs such as yayo and Ex pills are bought and sold between foreigners. Two other British citizens and an Indian have already been convicted and sentenced to prison in connection with the bust.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-714688\" alt=\"Lindsay June Sandiford\" src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/lindsay-june-sandiford-2.jpg?w=635&#038;h=981\" width=\"635\" height=\"981\" /></p>\n<p>The folks in Bali are definitely part of the &#8220;Not-Fawkin&#8217;-Around-Crew&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In its verdict, a panel of Denpasar District Court judges concluded that Sandiford had damaged the image of Bali as a tourism destination and weakened the government&#8217;s drug prevention program.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We found no reason to lighten her sentence,&#8221; said Amser Simanjuntak, who headed the judicial panel.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Can you imagine if America was executing people for drug offenses??? Clearly this woman broke the law, but hopefully she can get out of the death penalty sentence and just serve time.</p>\n<p><em>Image via AP</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Tue, 22 Jan 2013 17:38:12 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/714677/elsewhere-in-the-world-british-grandmother-sentenced-to-death-for-smuggling-2-5-million-in-white-girl-through-bali-43081/"]},{"title":["Certified Links"],"link":["http://bossip.com/714779/certified-links-660/"],"description":["<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/714779/certified-links-660/d_angelo/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-714786\"><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/d_angelo.jpeg?w=620&#038;h=413\" alt=\"D_Angelo\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-714786\" /></a></p>\n<p>?uestlove Says D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s New Album Now &#8220;99% Done,&#8221; Calls It A &#8220;Classic&#8221; (<a href=\"http://hiphopwired.com/2013/01/22/uestlove-says-dangelos-new-album-now-99-done-calls-it-a-classic/\" target=\"_blank\">GO</a>)</p>\n<p>Sheryl Crow My Lips Are Sealed On Lance Armstrong Drama (<a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/22/sheryl-crow-lance-armstrong-video-craigs-wont-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">GO</a>)</p>\n<p>Teen Mom Jenelle’s Husband Is Already Cheating On Her Or Vice Versa (<a href=\"http://www.thesuperficial.com/teen-mom-jenelle-cheating-courtland-rogers-pregnant-01-2013\" target=\"_blank\">GO</a>)</p>\n<p>Behind The Scenes Of Ne-Yo, And French Montana&#8217;s &#8220;Let Me Love You (Remix)&#8221; Video [PHOTOS] (<a href=\"http://hiphopwired.com/2013/01/22/behind-the-scenes-of-ne-yo-and-french-montanas-let-me-love-you-remix-video-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">GO</a>)</p>\n<p>Very VH1 Breaks Down The 2013 Inauguration, Justin Bieber’s Butt Pic &amp; More!

I&#8217;ve seen, growing up, when a woman or a man in a relationship—it doesn&#8217;t matter which one—doesn&#8217;t feel confident, they feel a bit trapped. Your self-worth is determined by you. You don&#8217;t have to depend on someone telling you who you are.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>On how child-birth affected her life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I gave birth, that was the first time I truly let go and surrendered. And it taught me how amazing that feels&#8230; Giving birth made me realize the power of being a woman. I have so much more substance in my life.  And expressing that excitement and that sensuality and the connection I have with my husband—I&#8217;m a lot more comfortable with that now. I actually feel like my child introduced me to myself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hit the flippy to see behind the scenes pics, video, and read what else King Bey had to say to her loyal <strike>fans</strike> Stans.</p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/beyonce-outtake-1.jpg?w=635&#038;h=801\" alt=\"beyonce-outtake-1\" width=\"635\" height=\"801\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-714716\" /></p>\n<p>On the pregnancy rumors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I felt like I kind of had to protect my mother, because when people made up the silliest rumor about me not really being pregnant \u0014She was there when I went through all of those things. And my sister.  They were very, very defensive.

Unlike solo artists that started out, my foundation is being in a group and being with other women that needed—we needed each other so much. I mean, it&#8217;s harmony.  And we were super tight.  We could walk into a room and not give each other the key and sing in perfect harmony. It gives me chills.

We’ve gone through so many problems and fights that I highly doubt we would work out as a couple, but recently I have actually overlooked the past problems we’ve had (the disrespect of each other’s family, the late night one-sided shouting matches, the phone calls to the authorities) and have tried to clean up my trysts to be a quality boyfriend.</p>\n<p>In the past, I was not interested in committing long term to anyone. I’m only 23 years old. Two months ago, she has made it clear that over the 4 1/2 years she has had a friend that she loves and grown interested in being with. I mean she pulled out all of the stops to make it known that she is heavily interested in him, going as far to mention he wanted to marry her and she regrets not going forth with it. I will admit that it stung given I do deeply care for her, but I understand that if I do not commit someone else will and if it bothers me then I have no one to blame but myself. I voiced my feelings but I was supportive of her decision. Her seeing my genuine aspect on the situation, she elected to break it off with him and pursue something with me. For once I was apt to it. But, now I do not know what to do.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago she had left a conversation open that she had with him. Curiosity got the best of me and I read it. After such, I did approach her about it, but I expressed that it was none of my business. I was wrong to even invade her personal privacy and sincerely apologized. I could have easily just chalked it up and kept it secret but I’m trying to be upfront and honest more. My point is I recognized that it was not for me to see because it didn’t concern me (regardless some of the conversations were about me).</p>\n<p>Now that the back story has been provided… Those 2 months prior while we were having major issues, I must stress that we were not in a committed relationship (that’s evident since she was entertaining marriage with him). I am pretty proud of my “lower region” and during one night of extreme boldness, I made a video of myself showing off my package. I then sent it to any friend who had an interest in seeing what qualities I possess below the belt. I have no shame in what I done because that’s my personal business that doesn’t affect anyone but me and the persons I sent it to.</p>\n<p>Well, recently, my daughter’s mother was going through my e-mails and found the string of outgoing e-mails of me sending it to people. Mind you this happened 2 months ago so she would have had to search to find something incriminating. Her findings led to a one-sided argument wherein I had no remorse over the situation. In fact, I felt it was similar to me violating her personal space. However, not once during the argument did she admit her wrongdoing or even apologized. Also, in the group of people was a bi-sexual male friend who enjoys seeing such. I don’t mind because with most friends it’s a “look at what you can’t touch.” But, her noticing his name, she proceeded to call me gay and wondering if I am really bi-sexual. I have no attraction to him at all, or any male in that regard. I’m guilty of just showing off, no matter what gender the eyes are.</p>\n<p>My questions are: What’s the difference between her snooping and my snooping? Am I wrong to not feel an ounce of remorse? Am I really gay and just don’t know it!?! I need it straight from my gay best friend! – <strong>Trying To Make Sense Of It All</strong></p>\n<p>Dear <strong>Mr. Trying To Make Sense Of It All<em>,</em></strong></p>\n<p>Uhm, wow, okay. So, you just going to pull your d**k out, make a video of it, send it to all your friends, including your bi-sexual male friend, and you want to know if you’re gay or bi-sexual and don’t know it, and if your should feel any ounce of remorse? Hmmm, what do you think? Chile, I tell you the slow gene is running rampant. I’m so glad I didn’t eat those school lunches. The kids today are digesting those hormonal injected products and it’s affecting their brains, i.e. you, Forrest Gump, whose brain in your manhood is larger than the brain on your shoulders.</p>\n<p>I mean let’s re-evaluate what you did. And, I need for you to sit your behind in the front row of this class. And, stop rocking back and forth clapping your hands and making those funny noises. I don’t have time for this.</p>\n<p>You sent a video of your d**k to your friends, and in particular to one of your male friends whom you know is bi-sexual just to let him know big you are in your lower region, and to say, “Hey, look what you’ll never get and can’t touch.” I’m sorry, but err uhm, I don’t know any straight man who would send a video of his d**k to another man just to show him what he has and to flaunt it for another man. So, are you gay or bi-sexual and just don’t know it? I really wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. I was really rooting for you and thought to myself, “Well, he’s young. He was just showing off and wanted to do something bold and outrageous. And, perhaps he was upset over his child’s mother and the situation she had with the other guy.”  But, then I thought about it long and hard, and then I asked some heterosexual men. Yes, I took a poll (much bigger than yours I bet. LOL! Pun intended).</p>\n<p>When I told these men what you had done their first response was silence. Yes, each man got quiet on me. And, of course I got the blank stares (*  *).  Sort of like every reader who has read your letter and thought, “What the &#8216;F&#8217;!'” So, after these men went silent, I repeated what you did. Then, ironically, each man said to me, “He did this intentionally? He knowingly sent it to another dude?” I swear to you they all asked me these questions. So, I said, yes that you knowingly and intentionally sent it to another dude. And, you know what all of these men said about you, “HE’S GAY!”</p>\n<p>Now, you said you are not attracted to him, and that you have no attraction to any guy whatsoever. But, ask yourself this question and then I’m done with your silly “wanting to experiment but scarred narrow a**,” part of your letter. If you are not attracted to him, have no interest in him, and you don’t like men, then why would you send a video of your d**k to another man? What is the purpose in that? Obviously something within you wanted to get some pleasure out of it, and if you get pleasure out of letting another man view, admire, and desire your man meat then maybe, just maybe there is something you are denying within yourself. You can digest it, marinate on it, and let it simmer while you figure it out, but I’m moving on. And, by the way, it&#8217;s a violation of friendship to send naked pictures, videos, and another thing to your friends. Who wants to see that? I know I&#8217;m not interested in viewing my friend&#8217;s private regions. And, I would be offended if they sent it to me.</p>\n<p>Now, here is the thing: You and your child’s mother don’t belong together. Let her go. Let her be with the other man. The only reason she got a response out of you and got you to show some interest is when she mentioned to you that another man had asked her to marry him. Besides, she it&#8217;s been going on for the four and half years you&#8217;ve been together. So, therefore, she obviously has been keeping her options open because she doesn&#8217;t feel you are the one for her. So, why do you want to interrupt her happiness and her well-being if she is in love with someone else besides you? If she is keeping her options open and is not certain about her future with you, then why not re-evaluate your relationship and recognize that though you may be good parents to your child, you may not be good to one another in an intimate and personal relationship.</p>\n<p>And, besides, you two don’t trust one another. All this snooping around and invading each other’s privacy. What the “F”? And, no there is no difference between her snooping and your snooping. You’re both wrong! And, please tell me why you want to be with someone and you can’t trust them? SMDH! But, you know what, both of you got exactly what you deserved. That’s what happens when you start checking someone’s email, phone, pants pockets, purses, and bedrooms. You’re not going to be happy with what you find. Y’all are truly special and I mean special needs. I don’t understand how you two were able to procreate with your helmets knocking into one another. Maybe that’s why you’re developed so largely in your lower region because every place else you’re severely lacking.</p>\n<p>Look, <strong>Mr. Trying To Make Sense Of It All</strong>, you’ve already mentioned that in the four and half years in an off and on relationship with your child’s mother that you highly doubt anything would ever manifest into something serious. So, what’s the problem? What are you asking me? Your past problems with her are tell-tale signs of what to expect in your future. Sure, you can change, and so could she, but in the four and half years of drama, is the stress and aggravation really worth it? Chile, puhlease! You better get yourself together, move on, find a dude, I mean a woman, who loves you for you and wants to be with you. Find someone you are willing to work on building a relationship with, and let him, I mean her, be a part of your life. Continue to be a father to your child, work with your ex on maintaining a good relationship of open communication and support for your child. That is what really matters in the long run. And, don’t fret, you’ll find the right guy, I mean girl, to call your own. In the meantime, stop sending videos of your d**k to folks. It’s time to grow up and act your age, and not your d**k size. –<strong> Terrance Dean</strong> <strong><em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p>Hey Bossip Fam, what do you think?

McDonald&#8217;s and Finley&#8217;s Management deny any liability but say the settlement is in their best interests.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ahmed bought a chicken sandwich in September 2011 at a Dearborn McDonald&#8217;s but found it wasn&#8217;t halal — meaning it didn&#8217;t meet Islamic requirements for preparing food. Islam forbids consumption of pork, and God&#8217;s name must be invoked before an animal providing meat for consumption is slaughtered.</p>\n<p>Dakhlallah said there are only two McDonald&#8217;s in the United States that sell halal products and both are in Dearborn, which has one of the nation&#8217;s largest Arab and Muslim communities. Overall, the Detroit area is home to about 150,000 Muslims of many different ethnicities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Damn, who knew that McDonald&#8217;s was catering to our muslim brothers and sisters?</p>\n<blockquote><p>The locations advertise that they exclusively sell halal Chicken McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches and they have to get those products from an approved halal provider, Dakhlallah said. He said there was no evidence of problems on the production side, but he alleges that the Dearborn location on Ford Road sold non-halal products when it ran out of halal.</p>\n<p>Dakhlallah said he was approached by Ahmed, and they conducted an investigation. A letter sent to McDonald&#8217;s Corp. and Finley&#8217;s Management by Dakhlallah&#8217;s firm said Ahmed had &#8220;confirmed from a source familiar with the inventory&#8221; that the restaurant had sold non-halal food &#8220;on many occasions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After they received no response to the letter, Dakhlallah said, they filed a lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court in November 2011 as part of a class action.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Islam: 1, McDonald&#8217;s: 0</p>\n<p><em>Image via EFI</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Tue, 22 Jan 2013 13:52:42 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/714571/michigan-mcdonalds-settles-700000-lawsuit-with-muslim-group-for-falsely-advertising-that-chicken-sandwich-was-halal/"]},{"title":["For Discussion: African-Americans Have Higher Expectations For President Obama To Address The “Black Struggle” In Second Term"],"link":["http://bossip.com/714576/for-discussion-african-americans-have-higher-expectations-for-president-obama-to-address-the-black-struggle-in-second-term/"],"description":["<p><a href=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bo.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bo.jpg?w=640&#038;h=366\" alt=\"2013 Presidential Inauguration\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-714592\" /></a></p>\n<p>This time around the African-American community hopes for the <a href=\"http://bossip.com/category/celeb-directory/barack-obama/\" target=\"_blank\">POTUS to work harder</a> on issues involving civil rights and racial and economic equality.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/blacks-see-new-patience-and-high-expectations-for-obama.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">NY Times:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>On Monday, President Obama placed his hand on Dr. King’s personal Bible to take a second, ceremonial oath of office, he will be symbolically linking himself to the civil rights hero. But Mr. Brown, along with other African-Americans interviewed recently, said their excitement would be laced with a new expectation, that Mr. Obama move to the forefront of his agenda the issues that Dr. King championed: civil rights and racial and economic equality.</p>\n<p>In interviews with experts and black leaders, some, like Mr. Brown, say they have been disappointed by the slow pace of change for African-Americans, whose children, for instance, are still more likely to live in poverty than those of any other race.  “The hope for Obama’s presidency was that there would be more help for places like Oakland and other urban areas that need support, safety and jobs,” Mr. Brown said. “He made people feel like anything is possible.”</p>\n<p>African-Americans remain overwhelmingly supportive of the president, as evidenced by their enthusiastic turnout on Election Day and for the inauguration festivities and Monday’s holiday celebrating Dr. King’s birthday. Thousands of black Americans have descended on Washington from across the nation for the many parties and observances and visits to the King memorial.</p>\n<p>They have developed a protective stance toward Mr. Obama, acknowledging the limits of his power and the voraciousness of his critics. Many cite the power of representation, the visual message of a prosperous, cohesive black family being beamed around the country and the world, and the untold aspirations that vision inspires.  But African-Americans roundly reject the notion that Mr. Obama’s election has eased racial tensions or delivered the nation to a new post-racial reality.</p>\n<p>“I think the great mass of black people have shown tremendous patience, discipline and understanding, recognizing the dilemma that he faces,” said Randall L. Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of “The Persistence of the Color Line: Racial Politics and the Obama Presidency.”</p>\n<p>Still, Professor Kennedy said Mr. Obama had been “somewhat diffident” about issues that would be of special significance to African-Americans, like the disproportionate number of blacks in prison or urban poverty. Blacks understand, he added, that that perceived hesitation “was probably a virtual requirement” for him to be elected in the first place.</p>\n<p>“Everyone agrees that you wish more was done the first term,” said Debra Lee, the chief executive of Black Entertainment Television. “But you look at politics and realize that the president can’t wave a wand and get things done by himself.”</p>\n<p>The activist and academic Cornel West says he is outraged that Mr. Obama would use Dr. King’s personal Bible at the inauguration without endorsing Dr. King’s “black freedom struggle.”  “Martin went to jail talking about carpet bombing in Vietnam and trying to organize poor people, fighting for civil liberties,” Mr. West said. The president, he said, “has a compromising kind of temperament.”</p>\n<p>But others in the civil rights movement say the president has a broader role.  “I told this president early on that I’ll be the head of the N.A.A.C.P., he can be head of the country,” said Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the civil rights organization.  He and others credit Mr. Obama’s cool temperament.</p>\n<p>“Obama very effectively used positive messages to bring the racial and ethnic groups together, not divide them,” said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist and the author of “More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City.”</p>\n<p>“In terms of race and ethnic relations,” Dr. Wilson said, “he is the right president during these hard economic times because social tensions are indeed high.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Discuss&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>WENN</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Tue, 22 Jan 2013 13:45:24 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/714576/for-discussion-african-americans-have-higher-expectations-for-president-obama-to-address-the-black-struggle-in-second-term/"]},{"title":["Angry Birds: Evelyn And Shaunie Spazz Out At Tasha Marbury’s BBW Birthday Party After She Shows Up 2 Hours Late"],"link":["http://bossip.com/714557/angry-birds-evelyn-and-shaunie-make-a-scene-at-tasha-marburys-bbw-birthday-party-after-she-shows-up-2-hours-late/"],"description":["<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-714578\" alt=\"BBWCast\" src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bbwcast.jpg?w=605&#038;h=402\" width=\"605\" height=\"402\" /></p>\n<p>Back like they never left</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Evelyn Lozada And Shaunie O&#8217;Neal Storm Out Of BBW Birthday Party</h2>\n<p>BBW newcomer<a href=\"http://bossip.com/689084/athletes-and-hoes-ex-baller-stephon-marbury-says-hes-done-makin-it-rain-on-his-former-sidepiece-to-keep-her-mouth-shut/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tasha Marbury</a> was reportedly on her best diva ish at her NYC birthday party/charity event last week that was also a taping for the show.</p>\n<p>According to our source who was in the building for the festivities, Mrs. Marbury, who is the wife of former NBA baller Stephon Marbury, arrived 2 hours late for her party and was heated to find that<a href=\"http://bossip.com/704135/surprise-surprise-evelyn-and-chad-step-out-together-for-the-first-time-since-divorce-photos/\" target=\"_blank\"> fellow cast members Evelyn</a>, Shaunie and Suzie had left the party after letting the cameras know that they were none too pleased with Tasha&#8217;s fashionably late arrival.</p>\n<p>Noticeably absent from the party was <a href=\"http://bossip.com/714475/tami-roman-basketball-wives-talks-about-going-at-shaunie-oneal-in-new-season-and-the-show-being-more-family-oriented-video/\" target=\"_blank\">BBW veteran Tami Roman</a>&#8230;.hmmmm.

“horrific” scene after they arrived at the New Mexico home where a teenage boy allegedly killed his two parents and three siblings late Saturday night.  The five family members were found in their rural home outside Albuquerque. Police identified the victims as Greg Griego, 51; Sara Griego, 40; and their children Zephania Griego, 9; Jael Griego, 5; and Angelina Griego, 2.</p>\n<p>Their alleged attacker was identified by police as another family member, 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego, the Associated Press reported.  The boy was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death, according to the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department.  He has been placed in a juvenile detention center, according to police.</p>\n<p>Police found multiple weapons, including an AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle, near the scene of the shooting, according to the AP.  “The victims all had multiple gunshot wounds, and there appeared to be multiple weapons, including an assault-type weapon,” Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department deputy Aaron Williamson told Reuters.</p>\n<p>While little was known about the alleged shooter, a picture began to emerge Monday of his father. Greg Griego, identified as a  pastor at Calvary, a local church, was remembered as a caring family man.  “Greg loved his family, he loved his church, he loved God, and was very involved with and had love for people in prison,” Calvary executive director Brian Nixon told NBC affiliate KOB-TV. “He headed up our jail ministry, he had a passion for people and to help them.”</p>\n<p>“Our family is grieving this terrible tragedy,” family members of the victims said in a statement, according to KOB-TV. “We appreciate the prayers and support we have received and request that the media honor our family’s privacy during this difficult time.”</p>\n<p>Down the road from the Griego residence, neighbors were shocked to hear the news.  “It’s a horrible thing,” neighbor Peter Gomez, 54, told the AP. “You see all this stuff that happens all over the country, the shootings in the schools and theaters, and then it happens right here. It’s sad.”  Gomez told the Albuquerque Journal that he did not know the Griego family well, but that he used to see the accused teen walking through the neighborhood wearing &#8220;camouflage stuff.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jesus take the wheel and the rifles.

He then allegedly forced her back into the car, taking two cans of gasoline with him, and began to drive, USA Today reported.</p>\n<p>When Ramsey told the girl he was going to kill her, authorities said, she jumped from the vehicle, ran to a nearby home that had its porch light on &#8212; the Persyn&#8217;s &#8212; and pounded on the door.</p>\n<p>After letting the woman inside, James guided her and his siblings to a bathroom, locked the front and side doors of his house and then grabbed a hunting knife from his bedroom, the Detroit Free Press reported. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Her voice was, like, she was going to die if I didn&#8217;t open that door,&#8221; James told the Free Press. &#8220;She&#8217;s like, &#8216;We gotta hide! There&#8217;s someone out there who just kidnapped me and he&#8217;s trying to kill me,&#8221; he said. </p>\n<p>Moments later, Ramsey appeared on the front porch and began trying to smash his way into the home, screaming, &#8220;Let me in or I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221; </p>\n<p>Inside the darkened home, Persyn handed his cell to the victim to call 911 and then called his father, James Jr., who was picking up his fiance at the store her family owns. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We need help right now,&#8221; the terrified teen told his pop. &#8220;There&#8217;s a man outside our door trying to get in, and I&#8217;m really afraid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ramsey, who failed to break in, poured gasoline on the house and set it ablaze before fleeing, police said.</p>\n<p>In the bathroom, Acelin Persyn, James&#8217; 11-year-old sister, cried out to her brother. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted him to come in the bathtub with me and just hug each other and say good-bye,&#8221; Acelin told the Free Press &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what was going to happen, if we didn&#8217;t make it, if he actually did make it in here and my dad didn&#8217;t get home in time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The child’s father returned home soon after, He put out the small fire and began smashing windows to get to his children.</p>\n<p>At the same time, a deputy pulled up, saw a man on the front porch and drew his gun &#8212; thinking it was the rapist. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the dad! I&#8217;m the dad!&#8221; Persyn, 36, yelled, according to the Free Press.  </p>\n<p>The confusion was cleared up when James unlocked the door and the children spoke to police. The victim was later taken away in an abulance.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ramsey led authorities on a harrowing game of cat and mouse that ended with his death in a hail of police bullets.<br />\nBut before he was gunned down, he managed to post to his Facebook account.</p>\n<p>“Well folks, I’m about to get to get shot. Peace,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Ramsey also reportedly wrote on a friend’s Facebook wall: &#8220;It&#8217;s been real, bro, wish I could have hung with you once last time. Love you, brother.”</p>\n<p>Local police were able to catch up to Ramsey a few hours later, and a fresh ordeal began.</p>\n<p>With police gaining on him, Ramsey rammed his SUV into a police car, injuring the driver. Ramsey then jumped from his own vehicle and stole a sanitation truck, which he used to ram another police car, police said.</p>\n<p>The officer from the second police car exited his vehicle and opened fire on Ramsey, killing him almost immediately.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This guy sounds like he was completely nuts!

CVS has said the manager acted in self-defense after being attacked by Kyser.</p>\n<p>The video appears to capture Kyser fleeing to the alley with the store manager close behind him. There&#8217;s a brief struggle before Kyser hits the pavement, with the store manager on top of him.</p>\n<p>Another man appears to punch and kick Kyser, at one point stepping down on his hand while the store manager remains atop Kyser. More bystanders join in, helping to hold Kyser down. Eventually, Kyser stops flailing his legs, the video shows.</p>\n<p>Ann Marie Kyser, the victim&#8217;s mother, has filed a lawsuit holding CVS liable for his death. Pedro Villanova claimed self-defense after Kyser struck him, but admitted in court that he heard Kyser say &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; before dying.</p>\n<p>According to Salon, the police department decided not to press criminal charges even after the Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office &#8220;ruled the death a homicide.&#8221; No criminal charges are currently pending.</p></blockquote>\n<p>CVS has been strangling neighborhoods in its bizarre war with Walgreen&#8217;s for years.

They returned the following day for 223 animals including 100 pigeons and 30 rabbits.</p>\n<p>The sheer number of pigeons, which can carry airborne diseases, created a health hazard inside the house, Marquis said.</p>\n<p>Authorities were tipped off by complaints about a stench coming from the property.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yuck daddy!</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;He told us he took some animals from other people and other pigeon organizations.

It was an apparent reference to the do-over that was required in 2009, when Obama repeated Roberts’ flub and White House lawyers arranged a second swearing-in to ward off any questions about the legitimacy of Obama’s presidency.</p>\n<p>The partying began in earnest Sunday evening with a series of galas, including a candelight reception for donors at the National Building Museum, where the President drew laughs and applause by complimenting his wife’s new ’do.</p>\n<p>“I love Michelle Obama,” he said, “and to address the most significant event of this weekend: I love her bangs.”<br />\n“She looks good. She always looks good.”</p>\n<p>Vice President Biden also recited his oath — and he reached out to a daughter of the Bronx for the honors.<br />\nBiden tapped Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to swear him in, but she was due at the Barnes &amp; Noble on Union Square in Manhattan at 2:30 p.m. to promote her memoir, “My Beloved World.”</p>\n<p>Undeterred, Biden moved the ceremony up to 8:15 a.m. to accommodate the high court’s first Latina justice. And after swearing him in — at Biden’s official residence — she raced to catch an Amtrak train back to New York.</p>\n<p>Obama and Biden recited their oaths to fulfill the requirements of the Constitution, which mandates that the President and vice president begin their terms at noon on Jan. 20.</p>\n<p>Because the 20th fell on a Sunday, the official celebration will take place Monday, when the swearings-in will be reenacted with pomp and pageantry on the west front of the U.S. Capitol. As many as 800,000 people will watch from the National Mall. The ceremony will be followed by the inaugural parade in the afternoon and two inaugural balls at night.</p>\n<p>But even with appearances by James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyoncé, it will be a more muted celebration than four years ago, when 1.8 million people descended on Washington to witness history — the swearing-in of the nation’s first black President, who had promised a weary America both hope and change.</p>\n<p>Obama will lay out the broad themes of his second-term agenda in Monday’s inaugural address. He began working on it in early December, aides said, and he was still tinkering with it over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The aides said Obama would save the specifics for his Feb. 12 State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>“The inaugural traditions are a great symbol of how our democracy works, and how we peacefully transfer power,” Obama said on Saturday at a Washington elementary school.</p>\n<p>“But it should also be an affirmation that we’re all in this together,” he added.</p>\n<p>Between their two official swearings-in on Sunday, Obama and Biden met at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, and on a crisp and sun-splashed January morning, they laid a wreath to commemorate America’s war dead.</p>\n<p>They also prayed together at the historic 175-year-old Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, famous for once harboring runaway slaves, at a service to honor Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday will be celebrated with a national holiday Monday.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a great day in American history! Let&#8217;s all celebrate and pray for the health and safety of the leader of our great nation. </p>\n<p><em>APImages</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Mon, 21 Jan 2013 13:43:44 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713925/blissful-matrimony-dom-obama-sworn-into-office-for-second-time-with-his-bangin-wife-by-his-side-i-love-michelle-obama-i-love-her-bangs/"]},{"title":["Mo Money Less Problems: Ex-NBA Baller Allen Iverson Coughs Up $3 Million Divorce Settlement With His Now Ex-Wife Tawanna"],"link":["http://bossip.com/713920/mo-money-less-problems-ex-nba-baller-allen-iverson-coughs-up-3-million-divorce-settlement-with-his-now-ex-wife-tawanna/"],"description":["<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/713920/mo-money-less-problems-ex-nba-baller-allen-iverson-coughs-up-3-million-divorce-settlement-with-his-now-ex-wife-tawanna/allen-iverson-and-tawanna-e1332851441862/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-713926\"><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/allen-iverson-and-tawanna-e1332851441862.jpg?w=600&#038;h=415\" alt=\"allen-iverson-and-tawanna-e1332851441862\" width=\"600\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713926\" /></a></p>\n<p>Making it rain on them ex-wives!<!--more--></p>\n<h2> Allen Iverson Pays $3 Million Divorce Settlement With Ex-Wife Tawanna</h2>\n<p>Former NBA star Allen Iverson finally struck a deal in <a href=\"http://bossip.com/712847/its-a-wrap-allen-iverson-finally-reaches-a-divorce-settlement-with-his-now-ex-wife-tawanna-43081/\" target=\"_blank\">his bitter divorce battle with his estranged wife</a> and all it took was a cool $3 MILLION to bury the hatchet.</p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/20/allen-iverson-nba-divorce-settlement-3-million/\" target=\"_blank\">TMZ reports</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re told Iverson and Tawanna &#8212; who married way back in 2001 &#8212; informed a judge last week they had reached a financial settlement outside of court in their ongoing divorce case &#8230; just days before the two were set to go to trial. </p>\n<p>Sources connected with the couple tell TMZ &#8230; as part of the deal, the NBA legend agreed to pay Tawanna $3 million, paid out as a large lump sum.

Joseph Lowery remembers when the 1960s South was burning with racism &#8212; the day a white man walked up to him and stubbed out a lit cigar on his shoulder, when iced tea was thrown in his face, when four young black men were shot with pistols as he led a march against segregation in Decatur, Ala.  &#8220;I have been arrested and threatened,&#8221; he said last week. &#8220;Even when I was a little boy, 12 or 13, a policeman hit me in the stomach with his night club. … It makes me hate violence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At 91, Lowery has lived the civil rights movement, which comes full circle with the re-election and Monday&#8217;s inauguration of President Obama, coincidentally, but with great symbolism, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  Lowery was one of King&#8217;s closest aides and, in 1957, co-founded with him and Ralph David Abernathy the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which led freedom marches and voter registration drives.</p>\n<p>He also delivered the benediction at Obama&#8217;s first inauguration in 2009, addressing the continued scourge of racism.  &#8220;We tend to think of them in the same breath,&#8221; Lowery, who lives in Atlanta, said of King and Obama. &#8220;They are both committed to justice and brotherhood.&#8221;  Lowery describes his friend &#8220;Martin,&#8221; who would have been 84 on Jan. 15, as &#8220;the most amazing person I have ever known,&#8221; whose vision was rooted in his faith, a &#8220;gift&#8221; he also sees in Obama.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Barack&#8217;s background was entirely different from Martin&#8217;s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But he is touched by human need and suffering and the belief that we have the same moral obligation to care for the needy and bless the poor.&#8221;  Monday&#8217;s inauguration kicks off a year of important commemorations that propelled the struggle for equal rights forward: the 150th anniversary of the emancipation proclamation and 50 years since the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Mississippi black activist Medgar Evers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>R.I.P. to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>\n"],"pubDate":["Mon, 21 Jan 2013 13:34:41 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713911/reverend-joseph-lowery-compares-martin-luther-king-jr-to-president-barack-obama-they-are-both-committed-to-justice-and-brotherhood/"]},{"title":["Eff An R&B Manager Thug: Baby Daddy Matty Knowles Dragged Back Into Court For Making Threats Against Homewrecker Ex!"],"link":["http://bossip.com/713900/eff-an-rb-manager-thug-baby-daddy-matty-knowles-dragged-back-into-court-for-making-threats-against-homewrecker-ex/"],"description":["<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/mat-baby1.jpeg?w=450&#038;h=368\" alt=\"mat-baby\" width=\"450\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713917\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/?s=Mathew+Knowles&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\">Beyoncé&#8217;s dad</a> is in deep dookie for making threats against <a href=\"http://bossip.com/?s=alexsandra+Wright&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\">Alexsandra Wright</a>, the mother of his &#8220;outside kid&#8221;!<!--more--></p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/19/mathew-knowles-baby-mama-child-support-threat-email/\" target=\"_blank\">TMZ reports</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beyonce&#8217;s dad Mathew Knowles emailed an ominous threat to the mother of his 2-year-old son &#8212; or so the woman claims, and now she&#8217;s gunning for him in court &#8230; TMZ has learned.</p>\n<p>Knowles&#8217; baby mama Alexsandra Wright filed legal docs, asking the family court judge to up her child support to cover expenses for security to protect their kid.

It’s hurtful for my whole family.”</p>\n<p>The picture, which has since been removed, went viral a few days ago, causing an uproar in the social media community. From calling Trotter a “pervert” and to deeming the photo as “plain inappropriate,” social media users took to Twitter expressing their opinions about the post.</p>\n<p>Ms. Trotter wanted to clarify that her father was bathing in their large whirlpool Jacuzzi in their bathroom when the granddaughter walked in and asked her mother if she could go into the tub with him. After the girl asked to join her grandfather, both Trotter and his granddaughter put on swim trunks before getting into the water. Javon also adds that her daughter was only in the water for about three to five minutes, and she was present during the entire situation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She says that she simply does not understand why people misinterpreted the image.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I don’t understand — it doesn’t look bad. I would never thought he would do anything [inappropriate],” she contends. “I don’t know why people would think this way. I know my father and he would never do anything to his kids.”</p>\n<p>Although the photo was only on the account for about ten minutes before it was taken down, the daughter of the bishop says that it was only supposed to be shared among family members and is horrified that it was posted online. The photo was inadvertently sent by a family member to a person who manages his social media accounts, according to Trotter.</p>\n<p>“I would have not posted the photo online…We never wanted anyone else to see it,” she says. “[My father] is hurt as well, we’re his family. He doesn’t want people to be posting his picture all over the world.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you think the photo was innocent fun or straight up unholy???</p>\n<p><em>Instagram</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Sun, 20 Jan 2013 16:08:40 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713802/jesus-take-the-soap-mother-defends-photo-of-popular-chicago-preacher-taking-a-bubble-bath-with-her-4-year-old-daughter/"]},{"title":["For The Stans: BeyBey And Her Artsy Fartsy Fashion Style Are Headed To A Store Near You!

her 13-year-old daughter is being harassed because of her breast size and was floored by the response she got after calling the school district.  Tammie Jackson says her daughter Gabrielle is being sexually harassed because of her large breasts at Central Middle School in Moline Acres. She says the sixth grader has been dealing with bullying since last semester.</p>\n<p>Jackson called the Riverview Gardens School District to complain and was shocked by what she was told.  “It makes me feel like now you are telling me it’s my fault, it’s God’s fault the way he made her. The lady on the phone said they could transfer my daughter and said her boobs were so large she will always get teased. And the only suggestion she had for me is to have my daughter get a breast reduction,” said Jackson.</p>\n<p>Jackson also says her 9-year-old son Elijah has bullying issues. He has a rare heart condition and she says kids make fun of his surgical scars, causing him to make suicidal comments.  Jackson says all she wants is resolution to an issue she says can affect kids for the rest of their lives, “Talk with the kids. Let them know people’s bodies are changing, everybody is different, but God made us all great.”  Jackson says the superintendent called and said they are working on a plan to resolve issues for both of her children.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n"],"pubDate":["Sun, 20 Jan 2013 15:49:09 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713769/smh-missouri-school-tells-13-year-old-student-to-get-breast-reduction-to-avoid-bullying/"]},{"title":["Caption This"],"link":["http://bossip.com/713756/caption-this-155/"],"description":["<p><a href=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justin-copy.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justin-copy.jpg?w=634&#038;h=610\" alt=\"justin bieber moons people\" width=\"634\" height=\"610\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713757\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/category/celeb-directory/justin-bieber-celeb-directory/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Bieber</a> took a moment out of his busy life to pull down his pants <!--more-->and show off a little moon action for his Twitter followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Caption This.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Twitter/Instagram</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Sun, 20 Jan 2013 15:34:45 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713756/caption-this-155/"]},{"title":["SMH: San Francisco 49ers Baller Michael Crabtree Popped For Sexual Battery"],"link":["http://bossip.com/713741/smh-san-francisco-49ers-baller-michael-crabtree-popped-for-sexual-battery/"],"description":["<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/713741/smh-san-francisco-49ers-baller-michael-crabtree-popped-for-sexual-battery/628x471-19/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-713755\"><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/628x4711.jpg?w=628&#038;h=419\" alt=\"628x471\" width=\"628\" height=\"419\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713755\" /></a></p>\n<p>This has not been a <a href=\"http://bossip.com/?s=te%27o&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\">good week for superstar athletes</a>.<!--more--></p>\n<h2> Michael Crabtree Popped For Sexual Battery</h2>\n<p>Via <a href=\"http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2013/01/san-francisco-49er-michael-crabtree-investigated-sexual-battery/\" target=\"_blank\">RadarOnline</a> reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On the heels of Lance Armstrong‘s  stunning confession to doping and Notre Dame’s Manti Te’o being caught up in a bizarre Internet girlfriend scam, San Francisco 49ers superstar Michael Crabtree is being investigated for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>The wide receiver is accusing of committing sexual battery on a woman in a San Francisco hotel room early Sunday morning, the San Francisco PD said in a written statement.

indicted Friday on charges that he used his office for personal gain, accepting payoffs, free trips and gratuities from contractors while the city was struggling to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p>The charges against Nagin are the outgrowth of a City Hall corruption investigation that already has resulted in guilty pleas by two former city officials and two businessmen and a prison sentence for a former city vendor.</p>\n<p>The federal indictment accuses Nagin of accepting more than $160,000 in bribes and truckloads of free granite for his family business in exchange for promoting the interests of a local businessman who secured millions of dollars in city contract work after the 2005 hurricane. The businessman, Frank Fradella, pleaded guilty in June to bribery conspiracy and securities-fraud charges and has been cooperating with federal authorities.</p>\n<p>Nagin, 56, also is charged with accepting at least $60,000 in payoffs from another businessman, Rodney Williams, for his help in securing city contracts for architectural, engineering and management services work.

They’ve got something in the works.”</p>\n<p>They had plans to record a long time ago but a giant fight put their plans on hold.</p>\n<p>“They’ve been talking about the song so that isn’t new — they were suppose to be doing it months ago but sh*t got out of hand between them and they shut it down but now they’re back on it.”</p>\n<p>Although they were spotted together, that doesn’t mean Rihanna is ready to completely forgive Chris for hanging out with his ex Karrueche Tran on Jan. 6.</p>\n<p>“Rihanna, you know, she goes hard on him and that session last night was all business. Trust me, it was straight business and work. Her people were there, Chris had some boys there too, but it wasn’t anything other than work.”</p>\n<p>“They’re both serious when it comes to making music so whatever they were fighting over, they put that sh*t aside to collab together. I’m not saying they’re not in love or together or anything like that, but it was just strictly 100-percent business the other night. And that’s cool, too. No love lost.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Rihanna, Karrueche is still involved with Chris, both personally and professionally.</p>\n<p>“She’s still in the mix….she ain’t going nowhere. To tell you the truth, she will always be in his life in some way. It’s just the way it is and nobody can do anything about that.”</p>\n<p>And if you think he’s going to choose between Chris and Rihanna anytime soon, think again!</p>\n<p>“[Chris] brought this on himself, he wanted and got everything he asked for so it’s on him. He cool with it, he’s winning in the end.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/01/18/rihanna-chris-brown-relationship-close-tabs/\" target=\"_blank\">The site also says Breezy kept close tabs on the singer </a>during their period of not speaking:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“He sees everything Rihanna does and posts on Instagram — sometimes before she even posts the s**t,” a source close to Chris says. “And no, [he] ain’t tempted by anything she posts. How could he be? He’s had everything. You see what those photographs do, he ain’t tempted by s**t; he sees and I doubt she’s trying to tempt him.”</p>\n<p>But while her raunchy pics may not tempt Chris, that is not to say he does not appreciate her physique.</p>\n<p>“Chris thinks Rihanna is sexy as f**k and anytime she’s on the cover of something you know that [he] got his eyes on her. He keeps close tabs on her especially when they ain’t talkin — like now. But they cool.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>These two just can&#8217;t stay away eh?</p>\n<p>All the pics on the flip!</p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:both;\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/breezy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-studio.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/breezy-kingston.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-look.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-hides.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-green-nails.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chris-car.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-chris-crib.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-leaves-studio.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-staff.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-breezys.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-pullpants-up.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-studio-looks.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rihanna-chris-studio.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><em>GSI/SplashNews</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Sat, 19 Jan 2013 18:07:52 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713588/sneaky-freak-rihrih-caught-creeping-into-chris-browns-crib-for-some-late-night-naughtiness/"]},{"title":["End Of Days: More Than 30,000 Dead Fish Turn Up On South Carolina Beach Twice In One Week"],"link":["http://bossip.com/713609/end-of-days-more-than-30000-dead-fish-turn-up-on-south-carolina-beach-twice-in-one-week/"],"description":["<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-713630\" alt=\"02Dead-Fish_620x465\" src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/02dead-fish_620x465.jpeg?w=620&#038;h=465\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /><br />\nWhat the hell??<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Thousands Of Dead Fish Wash Ashore On South Carolina Beach</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/708459/what-the-hell-65-year-old-south-carolina-woman-killed-by-family-dog-while-babysitting/\" target=\"_blank\">South Carolina</a> residents might be steering clear of one local beach in particular for a while.</p>\n<p>Roughly 40,000 chubby lumpkins sea critters washed ashore on Pawley&#8217;s Island beach in a Georgetown County, S.C. town earlier this week.</p>\n<p><em>via <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/thousands-of-dead-fish-wash-ashore-south-carolina_n_2502438.html?icid=maing-grid7%7Caim%7Cdl23%7Csec1_lnk2%26pLid%3D259156\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a></em></p>\n<blockquote><p>Tens of thousands of dead fish washed ashore on a South Carolina beach on Tuesday, for at least the second time in a week.</p>\n<p>Approximately 30,000 to 40,000 menhaden fish washed ashore along a mile-and-a-half-long stretch of beach from Georgetown County, S.C., to Pawleys Island, said Pawleys Island Police Chief Michael Fanning, according to NBC News.

But it seems like in an effort to avoid startling all the non-black folks watching, somebody at ABC doesn&#8217;t want to make a big fuss about that. </p>\n<p>This week the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/arts/television/scandal-on-abc-is-breaking-barriers.html?pagewanted=1&amp;%2359;adxnnlx=1358514825-5e%20djvuRuiG14b3JjZiqVg&amp;%2359&amp;_r=1&amp;%2359;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">NYTimes did a feature</a> about the show where they explored whether or not the show&#8217;s success is a sign of post racial progress: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Scandal,” now in its second season, has been a success for ABC. Last week the show had 3.52 million viewers aged 18 to 49 and 8.4 million total viewers. Among the group aged 18 to 34 it typically ranks first in its 10 p.m. Thursday time slot. </p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>According to Nielsen “Scandal” is the highest rated scripted drama among African-Americans, with 10.1 percent of black households, or an average of 1.8 million viewers, tuning in during the first half of the season.</p>\n<p>One reason for that success is the casting of Kerry Washington, who became the first African-American female lead in a network drama in almost 40 years. (The first was Diahann Carroll starring as a widowed single mother working as a nurse in the 1968 series “Julia.” A second show, “Get Christie Love,” starring Theresa Graves as an undercover cop, had its debut in 1974.)</p>\n<p>Her casting has prompted discussion among academics and fans of the show about whether “Scandal” represents a new era of postracial television, in which cast members are ethnically diverse but are not defined by their race or ethnicity.</p>\n<p>“There’s an audience of African-Americans who just want to see themselves in a good story, not necessarily a race-specific show,” said Joan Morgan, a fan of the series and the author of “When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost,” a book about black women and feminism today. “It’s not about this being a black show,” Ms. Morgan said. “It’s about seeing the show where black women and other women are represented less about race and more about who they are.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kerry Washington weighed in with her thoughts about how the show&#8217;s success is a mirror of times changing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the success of the show speaks to how we have become more inclusive as a society because the fans of the show span all different races and ages and genders,” she wrote. “It’s very exciting.” </p></blockquote>\n<p>But producers of the show declined to discuss how race relates to the success of the show:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Shonda Rhimes, the executive producer and creator of the show declined repeated requests for an interview, and representatives for the show seem less interested in talking about the subject of race and “Scandal.” While excited about the show’s success among African-American audiences, they were eager to point out the show’s success among all audiences.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Could celebrating that this show is the result of a Black writer/producer, based on a real black woman (real Washington operative Judy Smith, a former member of the George H. W. Bush White House and well-known crisis manager who has represented, among others, Monica Lewinsky and Michael Vick) and starring another black woman, somehow hurt it&#8217;s chances? Is that why the network and it&#8217;s execs are eager to downplay the big &#8220;black woman moment&#8221; that may in fact be happening?</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d ask Oprah her thoughts, but seem to her doing something very similar when it came to her own audience&#8230;</p>\n<p>Is race really not that big of a deal when it comes to &#8220;Scandal&#8221;? Would you still watch if it was Lucy Liu or Jessical Biel and not Kerry Washington?

He dropped major cash and partied till the wee hours at the weekly Sunday party. Melo (who just finished a 15-day fast that he completes annually) and his entourage, including Swizz Beatz, were surrounded by plenty of bottles and plenty of girls. “They got crazy. It was a boys’ night out,” an eyewitness tells Confidenti@l. Melo was with fellow Knicks Tyson Chandler and bad boy J.R. Smith (Rihanna’s ex.) The group bought six bottles of vintage Dom Perignon, a bottle of Don Julio 1942 and rapped along to music by DJ Scram Jones. “J.R. even got on the mic and thanked the club for ‘their insane energy,’ ” says our spy. The bromance fest lasted until well past 3 a.m., when Melo was hit with a $7,000 bill.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wonder what type of cereal the classy ladies at the SL lounge tasted like?</p>\n<p><em>Image via AP</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Fri, 18 Jan 2013 15:36:09 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/713149/athletes-hoes-carmelo-anthony-has-a-crazy-boys-night-out-with-tyson-chandler-j-r-smith-in-nyc-43081/"]},{"title":["Dear Bossip: I Think My Girl’s Male Friend Is More Than A Friend"],"link":["http://bossip.com/713161/dear-bossip-i-think-my-girls-male-friend-is-more-than-a-friend/"],"description":["<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-713165\" alt=\"black-couple-laughing1\" src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/black-couple-laughing1.jpg?w=503&#038;h=302\" width=\"503\" height=\"302\" /></p>\n<p>Dear <strong>Bossip</strong>,</p>\n<p>The question I have is how can I tell when my girlfriend is in denial?</p>\n<p><!--more-->She has this guy that’s a friend, so she says. They have been friends for like 7 months. She says they have never done anything, but she tells me she goes to his house and sits in his room and waits on him to come out the shower and she says she watches him get dressed. I didn’t believe what I heard. And, she says nothing is going on. Just yesterday I found a condom wrapper on her bathroom floor. So, when I asked her about it she started laughing, talking about I put it there from the last time I was there. I know that wasn’t true. I don’t even use Trojan’s.</p>\n<p>So, the other morning she gets a bunch of clothes in the mail from UPS from her friend. I feel like I’m in competition with this guy. – <strong>Is She In Denial</strong></p>\n<p>Dear <strong>Mr. Is She In Denial</strong>,</p>\n<p>(*   *) Blank stare at you and this email. Uhm, I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news, but homie, you’re the one in denial. She clearly has game and is running it on you and her “friend.”</p>\n<p>Now, come on, bruh, what woman is claiming a man as a friend that she’s only known for 7 months? (Come, let me help you off that yellow bus. You’re holding up traffic.)</p>\n<p>And, for real, for real, she is sitting in his house, in his room, and waits for him to come out of the shower and watches him get dressed. But, they haven’t done anything? LMBAO! You’re just as gullible as you want to be, aren’t you? Naw, they are not having sex, he is banging her, and they may not be doing it at his house, but they sure as hell are doing it at her house. You found a condom wrapper on the bathroom floor and it’s a brand you don’t use, and she starts laughing claiming you put it there. (In my Fred Sanford voice – “You big dummy!”) If you don’t use Trojan condoms and it’s on your girlfriend’s bathroom floor, then how do you think it got there? I’ll wait for your response.</p>\n<p>Now, if you found a condom wrapper (no condom inside) on your girlfriend’s bathroom floor, where do you think it came from if you don’t use Trojan’s, and where is the condom? Again, I’ll wait for your response.</p>\n<p>Okay, I’m back. Sorry it’s taking me some time to answer your letter but there was this yellow bus sitting in the middle of the road and this boy was refusing to get off. He kept banging his head on the seat mumbling something about his girlfriend and her “friend.”</p>\n<p>Now your woman has received a UPS package filled with clothes from her “friend.” I don’t know what she is lacing her vagina walls with, but whatever it is it obviously has you delusional, deranged, and diluted.</p>\n<p>Look, <strong><em>Mr. Is She In Denial</em></strong>, let me wrap this up. It’s obvious your girl got another man and is playing the both of you. Her game is so tight that she got you believing imaginary tales of her being friends with another man, and watching him get dressed as he gets out of the shower.  (*    *) Blank stare. Chile, miss me and that train ride. If she is friends with him, then ask her to have all three of you go hang out. Tell her to introduce you to her friend. As a matter of fact, confront them when you do go out about the clothes he sent her and why he sent them, if he is her friend. Maybe he works at Macy&#8217;s and got a great discount. LMBAO! And, if you got the condom wrapper put it on the table and ask him if he forgot it the last time he was at her house. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t with you people. Boy, you really are silly and whipped on that girl’s coochie. She must have put it on you something awful. I suggest you get out of the relationship, move on, and stop being in denial about her situation with her “friend.” He’s not her friend. Well, maybe a friend with benefits. She is getting something from the both of you, and you’re stupid enough to continue giving it to her. Homie, you’re being played! Get your underwear from out your a** and man up. Stop being hooked on coochie and get hooked on reality! – <strong>Terrance Dean<em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p>Hey Bossip Fam, what do you think?

I do all of life’s daily tasks. The other day my wife and I stopped at 7-Eleven and I pulled up to the pump and I started to pump some gas. She went inside to buy something and was waiting in line. The guy in front of her sees me outside but doesn’t see her. He says, “Man, there’s Kobe Bryant pumping his own gas.” My wife says to the guy, “He wipes his own a$$, too.”</p>\n<p>She came back out and we had a big laugh about it. We both have the same sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that. But, yeah, I do the same things as everyone else. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do you have a thrill-seeking personality? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>[Smiles big.] Unfortunately, I do. I’d love to go skydiving when I’m done playing. I might jump back on the bike too. It’s about the challenge of overcoming the fear. If I’m afraid of something that only makes me want to do it more. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What do you Google? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Fourth-grade math problems when I’m helping my daughter. And if I can’t figure something else out, then I’ll look it up. But other than that I really don’t Google anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ever Google yourself?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>No. Why? I know everything there is to know about me. I know some celebrities are into that, but that’s not me. Some of them even have alerts sent to them.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why have you only won one MVP?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>Because I played with Shaq. It’s that simple. A lot of the time we cancelled each other out. I sacrificed a lot playing with him. I really did. I did it for the success of the team. If I never played with him, my numbers would have been ridiculous. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What do you do when you can’t sleep?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes I take an Ambien. But if my mind is racing, I may get up and do something. The other night I was in my hotel room and couldn’t sleep, so I got up and went across the street to see &#8220;Django [Unchained].&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What did you think?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>It was genius. Absolutely incredible. Everything by Quentin Tarantino usually is, but this took it to another level. It’s the way he tells a story and the kind of characters he creates. It was crazy violent, but the story is so strong and that’s what you remember. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite commercial you’ve ever been in?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Kobe System campaign was great. It was really smart and funny and turned out well. Working with Kanye West and Richard Branson was a lot of fun. Also, definitely the Black Mamba Nike spot that Robert Rodriquez did. I loved seeing how he worked and put things together. &#8220;Desperado&#8221; is one of my favorite movies.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Who would play you in a movie about your life?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t know. That’s a tough one. </p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What about Samuel Jackson? You cuss like him.</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>[Sheepish smile.] That would be something. [Does a brief PG-rated Sam Jackson impression.]</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What would happen if you tried to grow your hair out again?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>It would be a struggle. It would be awfully thin up front. There would be a two-month period where people would look at me like, what the f&#8212; is going on. It would just be messed up.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What’s your biggest pet peeve?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>I hate dog s&#8212;. I won’t go near it. So pissed when I step in it. I’ve got four dogs and I just don’t do dog doo. I’m a diva when it comes to that. Back in the day when I was in Italy, I used to order shoes from Nike all the time. I had to have all the fresh joints. I ordered the Elephant Print Jordans that were amazing. I went to the park to play and stepped in a huge pile of dog s&#8212;. You wouldn’t believe how mad I was. I was breaking off sticks to try to get it out of the crevices. I smacked them together and scraped the soles on the curb but couldn’t get it all out. Ever since that day I just can’t stand dog crap.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>So what are you going to do with the rest of your day?</strong> </p>\n<blockquote><p>I gotta catch a fishing boat. I’m taking my daughters fishing. It’s daddy time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Did this interview make you like Kobe more? We enjoyed the personal stories &#8212; but he gets the side-eye for blaming Shaq for not having &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; numbers. </p>\n"],"pubDate":["Fri, 18 Jan 2013 14:41:15 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/712934/kobe-bryant-says-he-pumps-his-own-gas-wipes-his-on-azz-and-likes-to-share-laughs-vanessa-and-i-have-the-same-sense-of-humor/"]},{"title":["Hide Ya Pets!

He tried to paint himself as just another rider who was forced to use PEDs in order to compete in a grueling and drug-soaked sport.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t invent the culture, but I didn’t try to stop the culture, and that’s my mistake, and that’s what I have to be sorry for, and that’s what something and the sport is now paying the price because of that,” he added. “So I am sorry for that. I don’t think — I didn’t have access to anything else that nobody else did.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency had this to say about Lance&#8217;s confession:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Tonight, Lance Armstrong finally acknowledged that his cycling career was built on a powerful combination of doping and deceit,” USADA chief executive officer Travis Tygart said. “His admission that he doped throughout his career is a small step in the right direction. But if he is sincere in his desire to correct his past mistakes, he will testify under oath about the full extent of his doping activities.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Says Lance&#8217;s LIVESTRONG Foundation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We at the LIVESTRONG Foundation are disappointed by the news that Lance Armstrong misled people during and after his cycling career, including us.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>As for Lance and his view on his questionable behavior:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I had this exercise because I kept hearing I’m a drug cheat.

I worry a bit about 2014, when we don&#8217;t have the President at the top of the ticket.

Seminole attacked her newborn baby’s father following an argument at their Seattle home on Jan. 6.</p>\n<p>Seminole, 25, is also alleged to have bitten a firefighter and threatened to kill a police officer while fighting them – with her infant daughter still attached to her – during her arrest.</p>\n<p>At 5:40 p.m. the day of her arrest, Seminole and the man were standing near the intersection of 25th Avenue South and South Jackson Street when Seminole yelled at her boyfriend. The couple’s 2-week-old baby was in a carrier strapped to Seminole at the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the play-by-play of the fade.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Weighing in at 270 pounds, Seminole was able to throw her boyfriend to the ground, a Seattle detective told the court, recounting witness statements. Several residents witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p>Seminole then began kicking the man in the chest, Senior Deputy Prosecutor Stephanie F. Guthrie told the court. Seminole, the prosecutor went on, “continued to scream at the victim and then began stomping on his face.”</p>\n<p>The defendant stomped on the man’s face at least eight times, knocking him out while seriously injuring his face, Guthrie alleged.</p>\n<p>Confronted by a witness, Seminole asked “You know how many times he’s kicked me?” before breaking off her attack, the detective said in court documents.</p>\n<p>Seminole left the scene before police arrived. According to charging documents, she was arrested after leaving a nearby convenience store, where she’d bought a bag of Funyuns.</p></blockquote>\n<p>LMFAO! What the hell does Funyuns have to do with ANYTHING?!</p>\n<p>This girthy heffa wasn&#8217;t done there though, her reign of terror continued when the cops showed up.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Writing the court, the detective said Seminole was belligerent when confronted by officers.

It is not clear whether they are naked.</p>\n<p>The viral image has since stirred a huge response from the online community with many calling for child protective services to get involved.</p>\n<p>One outrage viewer said: &#8220;This might seem innocent but my question to you is why on earth you are taking a bath where your 4/5 year old granddaughter can just walk in on you and question about the bubbles in the tub.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another wrote: &#8220;I simply could not find anything right with this picture and I looked for 3 minutes&#8221; </p></blockquote>\n<p>This morning the Bishop called in to the John Hannah Morning Show on iHeart Radio – Inspiration 1390 to give his explanation of the what has cause such a frenzy over the last few days.</p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.funkydineva.com/bishop-larry-trotter-explains-the-picture-of-him-in-the-bathtub-with-his-granddaughter-are-you-buying-it-audio/\" target=\"_blank\">FunkyDineva</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Trotter says he was in the bathtub, his granddaughter walked in and asked him about the bubbles in the tub. He explained to her that they were bubbles just like the ones she played/bathed in when she was a baby. Enamored with the bubbles, she wanted to get it. From there he put on trunks, the child’s mother put trunks on her, and the two frolicked in the tub. Mom snapped a photo of the two in the tub and another family member who manages the Bishop’s social media posted the photo. According to the Bishop, it was nothing more and nothing less. He also went on to mention that he has bathed with all of his children, he was raised that way, and made mention of the fact that coming up he and siblings / other relatives even shared bathed water.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you think the photo was innocent fun or straight up unholy???</p>\n<p><em>Instagram</em></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Thu, 17 Jan 2013 22:42:47 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/712937/what-is-wrong-with-this-picture-208/"]},{"title":["Cheaper To Keep Her: 10 Athletes Who Lost Big In Divorce"],"link":["http://bossip.com/712927/cheaper-to-keep-her-10-athletes-who-lost-big-in-divorce/"],"description":["<p><a href=\"http://bossip.com/712927/cheaper-to-keep-her-10-athletes-who-lost-big-in-divorce/2004-world-music-awards-after-party-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-712928\"><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/getty_e_121911_kobevanessa1.jpg?w=630&#038;h=354\" alt=\"2004 World Music Awards - After Party\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-712928\" /></a></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re an athlete there are tons of issues eating away at your funds.<!--more--> The IRS, hefty Cheescake Factory bills, and the cost of supporting everybody in the circle, have all contributed to the financial demise of some of sports&#8217; biggest ballers, but there&#8217;s another money grabber among us and it&#8217;s called divorce&#8230; <a href=\"http://hiphopwired.com/2013/01/17/cheaper-to-keep-her-10-athletes-who-lost-big-in-divorce-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">Continue</a></p>\n"],"pubDate":["Thu, 17 Jan 2013 22:17:27 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/712927/cheaper-to-keep-her-10-athletes-who-lost-big-in-divorce/"]},{"title":["Fawk A Thug: Armed Brazilian Thief Makes Off With Gold Plated Adult Toy Worth $4K"],"link":["http://bossip.com/712920/fawk-a-thug-armed-brazilian-thief-makes-off-with-gold-plated-adult-toy-worth-4k/"],"description":["<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/4985f92abbfdb749c1260d2d4ac0ccf4.jpeg?w=550&#038;h=407\" alt=\"4985f92abbfdb749c1260d2d4ac0ccf4\" width=\"550\" height=\"407\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-712923\" /></p>\n<p>Gold all in my box&#8230; don&#8217;t believe me just watch!!!<!--more--> A <a href=\"http://bossip.com/?s=freaky&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\">freaky felon</a> robbed a Brazilian adult pleasure shop for just one item, a specialty massager worth $4,000!!!</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/4k-golden-vibrator-stolen-armed-brazil-heist-000539959.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo News reports</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An armed man in Brazil has heisted an 18-carat gold-plated adult toy selling for $4,000 at a luxury adult pleasure shop.</p>\n<p>Police say he walked into the Er0tica Luxo store in Brasilia, tied up a clerk and took the item from its display case.

Her dark cloud lifted thanks to exercise, therapy and positive thinking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve dealt with depression,&#8221; the 32-year-old said during a break in rehearsals for a new touring production of &#8220;Fela!&#8221; that kicks off later this month. &#8220;I had to choose to get out of bed and do whatever I needed to do to be happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Williams says she suffered her first bout of depression at 15 or 16 and has managed to avoid medication. She is speaking out for the first time about her battle to encourage others to seek help.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taught, &#8216;Just go to church and pray about it. The Lord is going to heal you.&#8217; Well, in the meantime, I believe God-gifted people, physicians, doctors, therapists — that&#8217;s your healing. Take advantage of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Go see a professional so that they can assess you. It&#8217;s OK if you&#8217;re going through something. Depression is not OK, but it is OK to go get help.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Good for Michelle for speaking out about mental health. Depression and other personality disorders widely go untreated in the Black community because mental health is still considered taboo.

The difference in this case is that Mayoue is not representing a high profile client, he is representing the Allen Iverson’s wife. The main issue to decide was how Mr. Iverson’s sizable trust money from Reebok would be handled in their divorce. Some speculated that Iverson was not going to fair to well with the judge in the case because of the fact that she and attorney John Mayoue had a prior financial relationship in that he assisted her in being elected via helping her raise substantial funds for her campaign.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well apparently that skepticism wasn&#8217;t warranted.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We spoke exclusively with Allen Iverson’s attorney after the trial and she stated, “Our client is extremely pleased with the outcome of the case even though we came in near the end of it, we had an uphill battle. Mr. Iverson showed up ready to actively participate in his case and fight for the things he wanted. I don’t know and can’t confirm that happened prior to us getting involved.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether there was any apprehensions fighting such a high profile case with so much controversy surrounding it, Attorney Thompson stated “we came to fight and to win for our client.”</p>\n<p>While the specifics of the deal will be kept confidential, both parties appeared to be satisfied with the outcome. The couple have a total of five children from the marriage.</p></blockquote>\n<p>AI has $18 million??

Leather Bar., directed by him and filmmaker Travis Mathews, is all about gay sex, and Franco’s damn proud of it.</p>\n<p>Premiering at this week’s Sundance Film Festival, the gay freak film reimagining 40 minutes of footage rumored to be taken out of William Friedkin’s 1980 drama Cruising blurs the boundaries between observer and observed, truth and fiction, delight and pain.</p>\n<p>EW talked to Franco about Interior.Leather Bar., and for a separate story, about kink, the documentary he produced about a San Francisco-based BDSM freak flick company, also premiering at Sundance. Not much was off limits for the Oscar-nominated actor, known for his multiple degrees, his creative projects, and movies spanning the gamut between serious drama (127 Hours), stoner comedy (Pineapple Express), sex and violence filled comedy (Harmony Korine’s upcoming Spring Breakers), and big-budget fantasy (Disney’s upcoming Oz the Great and Powerful).</p>\n<p>Hearing an actor enamored by girls and guys the world over talk frankly about sex, gay sex, and freakiness was, honestly, completely refreshing. You can almost hear boundaries splinter and crack.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So exactly how far is James going in this flick??</p>\n<blockquote><p>You’re a huge mainstream actor, you star in big budget movies, you’re considered a handsome leading man, and yet you also have this heavily artistic side that pushes you to take on controversial material. How did this hybrid identity affect Interior. Leather Bar.?</p>\n<p><strong>My history and my place in mainstream cinema helped us shape the approach we were going to take. That’s why I’m in the film playing myself, a version of myself. It frames the context of this movie and this material. There are documentaries about freaky flicks. I just made one, k*nk. The approach we took was not to really get into the ins and outs of freak flicks. It was really juxtaposing mainstream cinema and different kinds of representations of gay cinema.</strong></p>\n<p>In the Interior. Leather Bar. clip we’re premiering on EW.com, you flinch at the beginning, watching a heavy-duty sex scenario. Had you seen any freak flicks being filmed, in person, before Interior. Leather Bar. and k*nk?</p>\n<p><strong>I actually had seen some before. Before I did Interior. Leather Bar., I had seen some sex being shot at the k*nk.com facility in San Francisco. And when preparing for a role I did a long time ago called Sonny [in 2002], in which I played a male sex pro, I observed a guy sex pro on a date and he took me along and let me watch. I was probably 22. If I was flinching, it probably had something to do with the BDSM. There’s a guy named Master Avery, and he was spanking some other guys with a paddle. He was doing it a lot, so one of the guy’s a$$es got really bruised. So I was probably reacting to that.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ladies, as much as some of you like to have swirly desires for Mr. Franco, will his lil&#8217; romp with George, Jimmy, and Stan ruin the fantasy?</p>\n<p>Image via </p>\n"],"pubDate":["Thu, 17 Jan 2013 19:39:50 +0000"],"guid":["http://bossip.com/712815/gay-james-francos-new-flick-will-feature-freaky-same-sex-scenes-that-he-plans-to-participate-in-43081/"]},{"title":["Similac Slizzard: Newborn Hospitalized For Alcohol Poisoning After His Father “Accidentally” Mixes Gin With Baby Formula"],"link":["http://bossip.com/712800/similac-slizzard-newborn-hospitalized-for-alcohol-poisoning-after-his-father-accidentally-mixes-gin-with-baby-formula/"],"description":["<p><img src=\"http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/bottles.jpg?w=600&#038;h=430\" alt=\"Bottles\" width=\"600\" height=\"430\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-712821\" /><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Baby Suffers Alcohol Poisoning After Father Accidentally Mixes Gin In With Formula</h2>\n<p><em>via <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/01/17/baby-suffers-alcohol-poisoning-after-dad-accidentally-mixes-gin-in-formula/?test=latestnews\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News</a></em></p>\n<blockquote><p>An 8-week-old infant in Los Angeles became ill after his father allegedly mixed the baby&#8217;s formula with gin instead of water by accident.</p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s not clear whether the father was telling the truth, the baby was found to have a high blood alcohol level — equivalent to about five times the legal limit for an adult operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p>The baby was brought to the emergency room after his babysitter noticed that the infant was experiencing breathing problems— including gasping for air — and had gone limp. At the hospital, the doctors smelled alcohol on the baby, and ordered a blood alcohol test.

Never thought it would be me writing in for advice but here goes.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<p>I’ve been in a relationship with a wonderful man for 7 years. We’re high school sweethearts. He’s everything I want in a man. He’s a hard worker, great provider, excellent lover and the list goes on and on. The only problem we have his mother who constantly interferes with our relationship. We recently got engaged and not long after, the baby we’ve been trying so hard for we finally got.</p>\n<p>Life seemed to be perfect until his mother once again interfered with our relationship. She has a house that’s in his name that she cannot afford so she agreed to move out of the house so that we can move into the house and take over the mortgage. Needless to say she wants us to pay all of the bills, the mortgage and sleep in separate rooms while still living in the house with us. I refuse to take care of and provide for a grown woman who spends her money as she pleases while we’re carrying the burden.</p>\n<p>His mother is making our lives a living hell. She tells him all the time that I want him for his money, which aggravates me so much because I have a decent job and I equally contribute to our household.  I’ve tried my hardest to be respectful to her, but she doesn’t feel the need to be respectful to me. I won’t make it seem like I was an angel because we have passed words a few times and we both said out of pocket things, but because she is the mother of the man I love so much, I’ve never taken it to the extreme like she has.</p>\n<p>She’s constantly made negative comments about my pregnancy, and the stress of living with her caused me to lose my baby. When I returned from the hospital, she said things like, “That’s why you lost your baby,” in a very mocking tone.</p>\n<p>I love my fiancé with all of my heart and I would hate to lose him over his mother’s pettiness, but at this point I feel like I can’t take much more. He tries to defend me, but his mother makes him feel as if he has to choose between me and her. She’ll say things like, “If you want to be with her, don’t ask me for anything (not that he does anyway).” Or, “She’ll say that he’s not her son anymore (very childish).”</p>\n<p>I would never want to be the cause of my fiancé having an estranged relationship with his mother, but I’d rather not deal with all the extra, unneeded drama. He and I don’t have any other problems, which is why I want to fight for my relationship. What should I do? &#8211; <b>I Didn’t Sign Up For This</b></p>\n<p>Dear <b>Ms. I Didn’t Sign Up For This</b>,</p>\n<p>Uhm, ma’am, I hate to break it to you, but you did sign up for that –ish! The moment you agreed to move into the house while his mother was still there, you signed up for it. The moment you started going tit for tat with her, you signed up for it. And, the moment you entered the picture and realized his mother was still treating him like a baby, and him acting like a momma’s boy, you signed up for that –ish!</p>\n<p>You mean to tell me that all those years you’ve been with your man, and she is just starting to act like this? Girl, please. She has and was always been acting this way. You were able to avoid her because you lived in separate homes. Why the hell you moved into the house with her I don’t understand. Put her a** in a senior citizen’s home, or find her an apartment she can afford. But, living with your soon-to-be mother-in-law is not the tee!</p>\n<p>Then, on top of it, you knew your man was a momma’s boy. He’s always been between you and his mother, which is why it took him 7 years to put a ring on it. She was all up in his ear telling him not to marry you, and he was listening to her. Finally, something happened and he asked you to marry him. Was it because he knew that he was going to have to ask you to move into the house his momma is living in? He knew she was suffering financially, and he was probably paying all the bills, and it became too much for him, so since his name is on the home and he didn’t want to lose the home or his mother’s love, they concocted this plan of having him move in with her. He knew that he would have to get you on board and the only way to do that is to get you what you wanted, which was a ring. He’s trying to make everyone happen, yet, making everyone miserable at the same time. (But, this is all my speculation. There is something underlying in this story, and I would get to the bottom of it. It doesn’t sound right. I’m just saying.)</p>\n<p>Moving right along; I wouldn’t put up with all that nonsense, and her snide comments, especially after losing your baby and she had the nerve to say, “That’s why you lost your baby.” I would have politely turned and smacked the –ish out of her and then said, “That is why you don’t have a home. Your last day in here is today.”</p>\n<p>You’re going to have to sit with your man and have him put an end to this, tuhday! Let him know that you can only take so much, and that he needs to work on finding alternative housing for his mother. He should sit with his mother, and explain to her that it’s impossible for him to be a man, and trying to start a family with the woman he loves, while living with his mother. He should let her know how much he loves her, and he feels it is best she moves into her own place. He can help her look for a more affordable and reasonable living situation, and he will continue to visit her, and spend time with her, but he needs to make his home more of a home for his soon-to-be wife.</p>\n<p>At some point he is going to have to choose, and his mother is putting him in an awkward and uncomfortable situation. She is making him feel guilty for something. And, he is buying into it. Who knows what it may be. She could be ill. She could be hiding a prognosis from her doctor and is afraid of losing her son. She could be afraid of ending up alone. You didn’t mention if he had other brothers and sisters. Perhaps she feels she will lose everything. Does she have any friends? Does she have any hobbies? Instead of worrying about you, and his relationship, perhaps if she had a social life, and a man of her own, she wouldn’t be concerned about you and your relationship.</p>\n<p>But, there is a laundry list of things that can be going on. However, it’s time to put an end of this roommate living situation with his mother. It’s not working, and it’s already caused you to lose one child. Don’t wait until it’s another pregnancy and she’s stressing you out again. Your man has to see the severity of this living situation, and look to create a more harmonious relationship with you. It’s time for him to get off his mother’s tit, and suckling like a little a** kid, and start being a man, and building his life with you as his new woman. And, you have to put your foot down, and not relent to anything less than what you know you deserve. And, that is a happy home for you, he, and your children-to-come. – <b>Terrance Dean</b></p>\n<p>Hey Bossip Fam, what do you think?
